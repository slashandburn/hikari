Hikari helps create sorting links for Ruby on Rails applications. It also
allows sorting on associated models via scopes and default orders to be
provided in the view. It pairs nicely with Kaminari, but only works with
ActiveRecord at the moment.

Simple example

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :author, class_name: 'User'

    scope :by_author_last_name, -> {
      joins(:author).order("users.last_name")
    }
  end
  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
  end

app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
  
  def index
    @posts = Post.sort(params[:sort], 'title ASC')
  end

app/views/posts/index.html.erb

  <%= link_to_sorted 'Title', :title %>

  <a href="/posts?sort=title_asc" class="sortable">Title</a>

If a field matching the sort parameter is not found Hikari will attempt
to apply an ActiveRecord scope that is defined on the model. To sort Posts by
Author:

  <%= link_to_sorted 'By Author', :by_author_last_name %>
